# `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management-unstable-v1-client-protocol` Example

A simple example of a client that fetches `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management-unstable-v1-client-protocol` information and prints it to the terminal, using a GNU Makefile as the build system.

## Build
```
make
```

### More Information
This example serves as a base for creating other programs that use `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management-unstable-v1-client-protocol`. You will most likely need to install [wlr-protocols](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlr-protocols), which is available as a package on most popular Linux distributions.

### Why
While searching the web, I couldn't find any simple example, and the other codebases seemed too complex to use as a starting point. I hope this is useful to anyone facing the same issue.
